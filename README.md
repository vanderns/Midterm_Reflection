# Nathan Vandermeer Midterm Reflection
**Class Work** \
I believe that my work in this corse so far has largely been satisfactory. On the preparations, I have gone through every RStudio Primer to prepare myself for the activity in class. While I haven't gone through every reading for the preparations, I don't believe that it has negatively impacted my ability to go through the assignments. I also have gone through every class activity. Some of the final questions of the activity are unanswered, but they are completed for the most part. 


**Project** \
The final project I am working on with Manikumar can be located [here](https://github.com/vanderns/STA_418_Project). We are going to create Voronoi diagrams using Uber data. Originally, I wasn't looking forward to using Uber data, but after we made it centered around Voronoi diagrams, I am much more excited. I can think of two big questions that can revolve around our Voronoi diagrams right now:
* How do the diagrams change overtime?
* How sensitive are the diagrams? 

The first question deals more with reality, asking something like "This bar opened up recently, how does the model change?" Conversely, the latter question is more abstract, like "If we removed the region with the largest area, how would the model change?" or perhaps asking the same with the most populated region. I'm excited to look into these questions with Manikumar, and I think our work will go well.

**Course Objectives** \
Most of class time I'm comparing the work I'm doing with what I would do in Python or SAS, and while it may be simpler for me in Python because I'm more familiar with it, I want to learn were R's strength lie. In my classes, I'm largely discovering how data cleaning is such a huge task. There's a lot of trial and error in getting the data the way you want it. This has been most of our work so far in this class, along with making graphs and such. While we haven't really made functions or models, this will certainly be done in the final project. I find myself lookng up a lot of functions because I can't remember how every one works inside my head, so I'm definitely acquainted with source documentation and Google. Keeping my programming neat is a real struggle for me. In the activities it's not so bad because you have the assignment all planned out, but working on the project I will have to make sure that readers can understand it. I think that an appropriate grade for the first half of the semester is around an A- or B+. I largely get all the work done, but some finishing touches are missing.

**Other Comments** \
Awhile after we settled on the project, I had an idea for a project that I think I might've enjoyed more however. I would have liked to make a website with an interactable map that goes along with the book "The Storm of Steel" by Ernst Junger. It's a really good story about WWI, but I think it has more of a personal significance to me, so I think it would be a project I do on my own.
